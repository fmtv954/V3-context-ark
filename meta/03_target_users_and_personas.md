#### 3. Persona Prioritization for MVP

For the **50-doc MVP**, prioritize:

1. **Vibe Coder / Solo Builder**

Internal enterprise teams and more complex governance flows come later. The MVP should:

* Feel approachable to a solo builder.
* Be structured enough to scale into studio/agency workflows.
