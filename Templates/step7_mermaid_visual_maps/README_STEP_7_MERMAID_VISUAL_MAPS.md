# Step 7 – Mermaid & Visual Maps Pack (Doc 76 + Helper Prompts)

This step makes **visual thinking first-class** in your SDD workflow.

It gives you:

- An **opinionated, expanded template** for doc 76 (`76_system_maps.md`) focused on Mermaid and visual system maps.
- AI prompts that:
  - Turn your **project kernel + docs** into Mermaid diagrams.
  - Keep diagrams **in sync** with architecture, user journeys, and MVP flows.
  - Let Vibe coders "see" the system instead of just reading specs.

These files sit on top of the existing doc library from earlier steps.
You can either:
- Replace your original doc 76 template with this enhanced one, or
- Keep both ("76_system_maps.md" + "76_system_maps_enhanced.md").
