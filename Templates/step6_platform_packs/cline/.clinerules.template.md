# Cline Rules Template – Spec-Driven Development

SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Immediately read `./AGENTS.md` and any core docs you can find:
- 00: 00_agents_master_spec.md
- 07: 07_problem_pain_landscape.md
- 11: 11_quickstart_implementation_guide.md
- 18: 18_user_journeys_flows.md
- 31: 31_design_system_ui_components.md
- 60: 60_user_guide_knowledge_base_outline.md
- 72: 72_analytics_event_tracking_plan.md
- 76: 76_mermaid_maps_index.md
- 78: 78_prompt_playbook_library.md
- 83: 83_project_kernel_config_spec.md
- 84: 84_brain_dump_onboarding_script.md
- 101: 101_onboarding_script_library.md

2. Before modifying code:
   - Update or create `./progress.md` with:
     - What you are about to do.
     - Which docs you are following.
   - Confirm the plan with the user if the change is large.

3. If a user request conflicts with AGENTS.md or kernel constraints:
   - Ask for clarification.
   - Offer options (e.g., "Update the spec" vs "Implement as an experiment only").

4. Use Cline's ability to write persistent memory:
   - Maintain a `memory.md` to track open questions, TODOs, and spec drift.
   - Refer to it before each new task.

Use this as `.clinerules` in the repo root.
