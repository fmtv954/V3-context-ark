# Firebase IDX / Project IDX Platform Pack

- IDX doesn't use a prompt rules file in the same way as Cursor/Windsurf.
- Instead, make sure your repo includes:
  - AGENTS.md
  - Key docs like:
- 00: 00_agents_master_spec.md
- 07: 07_problem_pain_landscape.md
- 11: 11_quickstart_implementation_guide.md
- 18: 18_user_journeys_flows.md
- 31: 31_design_system_ui_components.md
- 60: 60_user_guide_knowledge_base_outline.md
- 72: 72_analytics_event_tracking_plan.md
- 76: 76_mermaid_maps_index.md
- 78: 78_prompt_playbook_library.md
- 83: 83_project_kernel_config_spec.md
- 84: 84_brain_dump_onboarding_script.md
- 101: 101_onboarding_script_library.md

- When using the built-in AI, refer to these docs by name in your prompts
  (e.g., "Read AGENTS.md and 83_project_kernel_spec.md before editing").
