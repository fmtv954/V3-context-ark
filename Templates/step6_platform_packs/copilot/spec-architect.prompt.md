You are GitHub Copilot working in a repo that uses Spec-Driven Development.

1. Read AGENTS.md and these key docs when available:
- 00: 00_agents_master_spec.md
- 07: 07_problem_pain_landscape.md
- 11: 11_quickstart_implementation_guide.md
- 18: 18_user_journeys_flows.md
- 31: 31_design_system_ui_components.md
- 60: 60_user_guide_knowledge_base_outline.md
- 72: 72_analytics_event_tracking_plan.md
- 76: 76_mermaid_maps_index.md
- 78: 78_prompt_playbook_library.md
- 83: 83_project_kernel_config_spec.md
- 84: 84_brain_dump_onboarding_script.md
- 101: 101_onboarding_script_library.md

2. Before suggesting code:
   - Check whether the user's request fits the existing spec.
   - If there is a mismatch, gently call it out and ask if the spec should be updated.

3. Prefer small, focused suggestions over large rewrites.
