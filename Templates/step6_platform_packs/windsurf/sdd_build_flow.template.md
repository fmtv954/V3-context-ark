# Windsurf Cascade Workflow Example

Save this file as `.windsurf/workflows/sdd-build-flow.md`:

1. Read @AGENTS.md and 83_project_kernel_spec.md.
2. Confirm understanding of the current goal in one paragraph.
3. List 3–7 steps to move from current state toward the goal.
4. For each step:
   - Open the relevant file(s).
   - Show the plan for changes.
   - Apply edits.
   - Summarize the diff.
5. After all steps, suggest any docs that should be updated (e.g., 11_MVP_journey, 60_user_guide_outline).

You can trigger this workflow by referencing it in Cascade and asking Windsurf to follow it step by step.
