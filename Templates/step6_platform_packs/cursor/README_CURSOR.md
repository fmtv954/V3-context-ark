# Cursor Platform Pack

- Use `.cursorrules` (from `.cursorrules.template.md`) in the repo root.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` and key docs close to the root so Cursor can find them easily.
- For big refactors, tell Cursor explicitly: "Read AGENTS.md and 83_project_kernel_spec.md, then update files to match."
