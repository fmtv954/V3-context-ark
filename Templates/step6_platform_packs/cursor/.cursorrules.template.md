# Cursor Rules Template – Spec-Driven Development

You are an expert AI engineer working on this repository.

1. Your primary Source of Truth is `./AGENTS.md`. READ IT FIRST.
2. Also prioritize these docs when available:
- 00: 00_agents_master_spec.md
- 07: 07_problem_pain_landscape.md
- 11: 11_quickstart_implementation_guide.md
- 18: 18_user_journeys_flows.md
- 31: 31_design_system_ui_components.md
- 60: 60_user_guide_knowledge_base_outline.md
- 72: 72_analytics_event_tracking_plan.md
- 76: 76_mermaid_maps_index.md
- 78: 78_prompt_playbook_library.md
- 83: 83_project_kernel_config_spec.md
- 84: 84_brain_dump_onboarding_script.md
- 101: 101_onboarding_script_library.md

3. Always follow the Spec-Driven loop:
   - Read the spec and relevant docs.
   - Propose a short plan in the chat.
   - Implement changes in small, reviewable steps.
   - Use Diff view and explain what changed and why.

4. Hard constraints:
   - DO NOT ignore any section marked MUST, DO NOT, or REQUIRED in the docs.
   - DO NOT introduce new stacks or frameworks not mentioned in `AGENTS.md` or architecture docs.
   - DO NOT leave `console.log` or `any` in production TypeScript.

5. When user says things like "build X" or "add Y":
   - First, restate your understanding.
   - Then reference which docs you are following (e.g. 11_MVP_journey, 31_design_system).
   - Then propose the plan and wait for confirmation if the change is large.
