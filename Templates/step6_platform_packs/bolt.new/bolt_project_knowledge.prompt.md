[PHASE 0: PROJECT KNOWLEDGE]

You are building this app using Spec-Driven Development.

The main spec documents in the repo are:

- 00: 00_agents_master_spec.md
- 07: 07_problem_pain_landscape.md
- 11: 11_quickstart_implementation_guide.md
- 18: 18_user_journeys_flows.md
- 31: 31_design_system_ui_components.md
- 60: 60_user_guide_knowledge_base_outline.md
- 72: 72_analytics_event_tracking_plan.md
- 76: 76_mermaid_maps_index.md
- 78: 78_prompt_playbook_library.md
- 83: 83_project_kernel_config_spec.md
- 84: 84_brain_dump_onboarding_script.md
- 101: 101_onboarding_script_library.md

You MUST treat these as the Source of Truth. Do not invent a different stack,
color system, or flow if they are already defined there.

[PHASE 1: ARCHITECTURE]

1. Read AGENTS.md and the key docs above.
2. Summarize your understanding of:
   - The product goal.
   - The core user journey.
   - The chosen tech stack.
3. Propose ONLY the folder structure and high-level components.
4. WAIT for confirmation.

[PHASE 2: WIREFRAME IMPLEMENTATION]

Once folder structure is approved:

1. Implement minimal pages and routes.
2. Use placeholder content guided by user journeys and MVP doc (11_...).

[PHASE 3: POLISH + INTEGRATIONS]

After the basic UI is working:

1. Add real copy based on docs (60_user_guide_outline, 100_marketing_site_spec).
2. Wire up analytics/events based on 72_analytics_events_plan.
3. Respect all safety/guardrail docs if present.
