# 00 – Vision & North Star

## One-Liner

Turn every QR scan into a real-time voice conversation that results in
a clean, actionable lead for the business.

## Problem

Small teams and solo operators miss calls and lose leads. Printing a
phone number on a sign or flyer is not enough; people don't like calling
and owners can't be on the phone 24/7.

## Solution

A browser-based voice receptionist triggered from QR codes, that:

- Greets callers in a friendly, branded voice.
- Asks smart qualifying questions.
- Summarizes the conversation.
- Sends follow-up summaries and tasks to the team.

## Why Now

- Voice AI and WebRTC are good enough to feel natural.
- QR usage is normalized post-2020.
- Many AI tools exist, but few handle voice-first lead capture for
  local businesses in a structured, spec-driven way.

## Success Metrics (MVP)

- Time-to-first-usable MVP for a solo builder: <= 2 weeks.
- Conversion rate from QR scan → call → qualified lead.
- % of calls with completed lead forms and Asana tasks created.
