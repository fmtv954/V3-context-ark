# 06 – Business Model & Revenue Strategy

## Revenue Model

- **Subscription SaaS**
  - Tiered pricing by:
    - Number of active campaigns (QRs)
    - Monthly AI minutes
- **Add-ons**
  - Premium voice (Cartesia, ElevenLabs, etc.)
  - Additional integrations (CRMs, SMS follow-up)

## Proposed Tiers

- **Vibe / Starter**
  - 1 campaign, limited minutes (e.g. 500 / month)
  - Basic email summary
- **Builder**
  - 3–5 campaigns
  - Asana integration
  - Analytics dashboard (basic)
- **Pro**
  - 10+ campaigns
  - Advanced analytics + custom events
  - Priority support

## Key Assumptions

- Early traction in niches where one extra deal covers the monthly cost
  (real estate, legal, HVAC, medical, etc.).
