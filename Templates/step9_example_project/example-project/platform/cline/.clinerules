# SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS – Cline (Quantum Voice AI Example)

1. On startup, READ `AGENTS.md` and `project_kernel.json`.
2. Maintain a `cline_progress.md` file in the project root:
   - Log what you understood.
   - Log which docs you used for each major action.
3. Before making large changes, summarize your plan in `cline_progress.md`.
4. If a user request conflicts with AGENTS.md or the kernel, ASK for clarification.
