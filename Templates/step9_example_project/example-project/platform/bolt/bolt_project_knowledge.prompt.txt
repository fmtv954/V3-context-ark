[PHASE 1: ARCHITECTURE]

You are Bolt.new, helping build **Quantum Voice AI: QR-to-Call Lead Agent**.

Here is the core spec (summarized):

- Tech: Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase, LiveKit, Deepgram.
- Goal: QR → call page → voice agent → lead capture → Asana + email.

DO NOT build the full app yet.

First:

1. Confirm you understand the goal.
2. Propose a folder structure for the project.
3. Outline which components/pages you will generate in later phases.
