# Windsurf Rules – Quantum Voice AI Example

- ALWAYS reference `AGENTS.md` and `project_kernel.json` before large changes.
- Use Cascade flows for repeatable tasks.

When I type `/plan-mvp`:

- Read AGENTS.md + docs/11_mvp_spec.md + docs/18_user_journeys.md.
- Generate a checklist in `PLAN_MVP.md` with clear steps.

When I type `/build-step`:

- Take the top unchecked step in `PLAN_MVP.md`.
- Implement just that step, using diffs.
