# Cursor Rules – Quantum Voice AI Example

You are an expert AI engineer working on Quantum Voice AI: QR-to-Call Lead Agent.

1. Your primary Source of Truth is `AGENTS.md`. READ IT FIRST.
2. Then read `project_kernel.json` and relevant docs in `docs/`.
3. Before writing code:
   - Generate a short plan in a new or existing `PLAN.md` file.
4. When editing code:
   - Prefer TypeScript with strict typing.
   - Do NOT use `any` unless the user explicitly approves.
   - Keep components small and focused.

When asked to scaffold the project, start with:

- Basic Next.js app
- Supabase client setup
- Minimal call landing page + placeholder voice agent hook.
