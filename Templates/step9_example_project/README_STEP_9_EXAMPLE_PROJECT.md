# Step 9 – Example Project Folder (Context Architect Hello Project)

This step gives you a **complete example project folder** that shows
what a *generated* Context Architect bundle looks like once:

- Onboarding → kernel → docs → platform packs → visuals have all run
- But **before** any actual app code is written

You can:

- Open this folder in Cursor / Windsurf / Replit and see how
  AGENTS.md, docs, and platform rules work together.
- Use it as a **golden reference** when wiring up your own pipeline.
- Or hand it to an AI dev tool and say: “Generate the actual code
  that matches this spec + kernels + rules.”
