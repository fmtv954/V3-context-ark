# Step 4 – Doc Templates (Batch 4: 10 docs)

This folder contains Markdown templates for the next 10 docs from `docs_index.json`:

- 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94

These skew **heavier on risk, compliance, reliability, and support**, e.g.:

- 85 – AI Evaluation & Benchmarking Plan
- 86 – Legal & Compliance Notes
- 87 – Audit & Logging Strategy
- 88 – Support / Success Playbook
- 89–92 – Reliability, incident response, SLOs/SLA, monitoring
- 93–94 – Data retention, privacy, and regulator-facing docs

The outline is similar to earlier batches, with language tuned slightly more toward
"constraints, risk, and MUST/DO NOT" so the AI knows these docs are more binding.
