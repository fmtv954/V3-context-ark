# Step 4 – Doc Templates (Batch 5: Final 8 docs)

This folder contains Markdown templates for the final docs from `docs_index.json`:

- 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102

These are mostly **launch / GTM / internal tooling / sandbox** flavored docs, e.g.:

- 95 – Internal Tools & Admin Console Spec
- 96 – Partner / Integration Program Outline
- 97 – Demo Script & Scenario Library
- 98 – Sandbox / Playground Environment Spec
- 99 – Regulator / Compliance Brief
- 100 – Marketing Site & Landing Page Spec
- 101 – Onboarding Script Library (Calls, Demos, Walkthroughs)
- 102 – Long-Term Roadmap & North Star

They use the same Spec-Driven outline as earlier batches,
but the "How AI Should Use This Doc" section calls out demo, launch,
and growth-focused usage more explicitly.
