# Step 4 – Doc Templates (Batch 3: 10 docs)

This folder contains Markdown templates for the next 10 docs from `docs_index.json`:

- 72, 74, 76, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84

These are mostly **analytics, AI behaviour, safety, kernel, and governance** flavored docs:
- 72 – Analytics & Event Tracking Plan
- 74 – Experimentation / A/B Testing Strategy
- 76 – System Maps & Mermaid Diagrams
- 78 – Prompt Library & Pattern Playbook
- 79–82 – AI infra, model routing, evals, safety
- 83 – Project Kernel Spec
- 84 – Onboarding / Brain-Dump Script

They use the same Spec-Driven outline so your onboarding flow + AI can fill them in consistently.
