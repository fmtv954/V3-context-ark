# 92 – Scaling & Capacity Planning

> How we plan for growth in users, projects, and AI calls.
> Audience: founders, infra, AI tools making infra or pricing suggestions.

## 1. Growth Assumptions

- **Expected growth (users, calls, data) over 6–18 months:**
  - {{scaling_growth_assumptions}}

## 2. Bottlenecks

- **Where we expect scale pain first (DB, AI cost, etc.):**
  - {{scaling_bottlenecks}}

## 3. Scale Strategy

- **How we’ll scale different layers (DB, cache, workers, queues):**
  - {{scaling_strategy}}

## 4. Cost vs Performance Tradeoffs

- **Where we prefer cheap vs where we prefer fast/robust:**
  - {{scaling_cost_tradeoffs}}

## 5. Notes for AI Tools

- Align infra-heavy suggestions with these constraints.
