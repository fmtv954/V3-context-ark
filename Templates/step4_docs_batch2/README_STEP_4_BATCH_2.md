# Step 4 – Doc Templates (Batch 2: 10 docs)

This folder contains Markdown templates for the next 10 docs from `docs_index.json`:

- 35, 38, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 70

Each file:
- Uses frontmatter with `id`, `filename`, `category`, `audience`, and `tags`.
- Provides the same Spec-Driven outline as Batch 1.

These templates tend to skew more toward infra, deployment, pricing/growth, and feedback loops, so they're especially useful as you move projects from MVP toward more serious/Pro builds.
