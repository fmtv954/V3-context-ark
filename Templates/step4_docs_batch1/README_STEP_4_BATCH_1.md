# Step 4 – Doc Templates (Batch 1: 10 docs)

This folder contains Markdown templates for the first 10 docs from `docs_index.json`:

- 00, 05, 07, 09, 11, 18, 21, 23, 31, 33

Each file:
- Uses frontmatter with `id`, `filename`, `category`, `audience`, and `tags`.
- Provides a structured outline:
  - Purpose
  - When to use
  - Inputs
  - Required sections
  - How AI should use the doc
  - Definition of Done
  - Notes / scratch

These are **generic SDD-friendly skeletons** you can customize per project.  
Later steps can auto-fill them from onboarding + brain-dump content.
